                    The History of Snare Drum Rudiments
                </h2>
                <p className="article__body article__body__history">
                    The 40 snare drum rudiments fall under five categories consisting
                    of traditional, drum corps, orchestral, European, and contemporary rudiments.
                    The list was compiled by the Percussive Arts Society (PAS) International Drum
                    Rudiment Committee in 1984.

                <p className="article__body article__body__history">
                    Initially, the National Association of Rudimental Drummers (NARD), established by 
                    a group that included George Lawrence Stone and William F. Ludwig, Sr., organized
                    a list of "13 Essential" rudiments plus an additional "13 Rudiments to Complete" in 1933.
                    These formed the Standard "NARD 26." The "Scottish Drumming Rudiments" sheet includes
                    46 rudiments, while the "French/Swiss Rudimental Codex" sheet includes 42. Overall, 
                    there are over 850 rudiments worldwide, but the 40 chosen by PAS are the current standards.
                    These include 13 "essential," a second set of 13, and a last set 14 fourteen rudiments.

                <p className="article__body article__body__history">
                    According to PAS, "all rudiments should be practiced: open (slow) to close (fast)
                    to open (slow) and/or at an even moderate march tempo."
